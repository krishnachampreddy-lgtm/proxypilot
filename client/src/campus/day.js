/*
  The school day timetable, shared by the 3D campus and the page around it
  (this file has no 3D code, so the page can use it without loading three.js).

  A real school day: the gate opens, students arrive, the assembly bell, assembly, eight
  40-minute periods with a bell between each (the teachers change rooms), a short break after
  the third period, lunch after the fifth, home time, after-school games and the staff meeting,
  then the teachers leave and the gate is locked.

  `speed` is campus minutes per real second. Busy moments play close to real time; lessons
  fast-forward, slowing right down for the minute or two either side of each period bell so the
  teachers can be seen leaving one class and walking into the next. A whole day takes about
  sixteen minutes on screen.
