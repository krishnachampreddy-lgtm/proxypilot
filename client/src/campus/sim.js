/*
  A school day for a thousand-plus students, from the gate opening to the gate closing.

  07:15  gate opens · teachers drive in and go to the staff room · buses park in their bays ·
         autos drop children at the gate · friends walk in together with school bags, climb
         the stairs, open the classroom door and sit down at their desks
  07:58  assembly bell · every class comes out of its room, down the stairs, into its line
  08:10  assembly · the whole school in class lines, teachers in front of the flag
  08:28  lines break up from the back, everyone goes back up to class and sits down
  08:40  lessons · a teacher at every blackboard, fans turning · a PE class jogs round the
         track · readers in the library · the HOD at her desk
  12:30  lunch · friends come down together and stand about in little circles, chatting
  13:10  lessons · football in PE
  15:20  home bell · classes empty out in groups of friends with their bags → buses (each
         leaves when its children are on board), autos queueing at the gate, or the walk home
  16:05  evening · teachers leave the staff room and drive home · the gate shuts at 17:35

  Busy moments run close to real time and lessons fast-forward (see day.js).
